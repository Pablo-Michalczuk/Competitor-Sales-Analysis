📊 Competitor Sales & Market Share Analysis — Power BI
Project Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution built in Power BI, focused on analyzing sales performance and market share for a manufacturing company within a competitive landscape.

The report integrates multiple data sources, applies robust data modeling techniques, and delivers interactive visual insights to evaluate internal performance, competitor positioning, and product-level dynamics across countries and time.

🎯 Business Objectives

The analysis is designed to answer key strategic questions, including:

How does the company perform globally and in its core markets?

How does revenue growth compare against top competitors?

Which manufacturers and product segments drive the most value?

How does sales distribution evolve over time and across regions?

Where are the strongest opportunities for competitive improvement?

🗂️ Data Preparation & Modeling

Integrated sales data from multiple files and geographies using Power Query

Performed extensive data cleaning:

Handling nulls and inconsistent formats

Restructuring tables (transpose, append, split columns from examples)

Optimizing data types and removing redundant fields

Designed a Snowflake schema with fact and dimension tables (Date, Product, Geography, Manufacturer)

Built a custom Date table using DAX to enable time intelligence

Optimized the model by filtering to the last three years of data and disabling unnecessary loads

🧮 Analytics & DAX

Created key measures for:

Revenue, Market Share, YoY Growth

Prior Year comparisons and growth rates

Top-N competitor analysis

Applied conditional formatting and hierarchies to support deeper product and segment analysis

📈 Visualization & Storytelling

Interactive dashboards with slicers, hierarchies, and drill-through capabilities

Comparative visuals to assess manufacturer performance and market contribution

Time-series analysis to track revenue trends and growth momentum

Data-driven storytelling using bookmarks, spotlighting, and consistent theming aligned with brand guidelines

🔍 Key Insights (Examples)
